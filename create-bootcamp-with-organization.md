* for the https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc repository under the organization account
* create an empty repository under the organization named `swcarpentry-YYYY-MM-DD-INST.github.io` that will host the build website
* Now clone the `bc` repository of your organization locally
* Add the website as the `publish` remote:

    git add remote publish https://github.com/swcarpentry-YYYY-MM-DD-INST/swcarpentry-YYYY-MM-DD-INST.github.io.git
